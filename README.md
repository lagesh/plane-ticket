More JavaScript DOM manipulation practice.

In this project, I built a boarding pass completely with pure html and CSS, and used vanilla JavaScript to manipulate the html form input so that the information provided on the form is automatically printed on the boarding pass.

I intend to learn more again about JS/CSS transitions and use it as a feature for when the form input gets displayed.
